In this project, I worked with a dataset that contains information about advertising expenditures (on TV, Radio, and Newspapers) and their corresponding sales data. The goal was to build a model that can predict sales based on the amount spent on these advertising channels. I started by loading the dataset and exploring its structure using methods like head(), info(), and describe(), which helped me understand the data types and summary statistics. I also checked for any missing values in the dataset to ensure its completeness.

To gain some initial insights into the relationships between the advertising expenditures and sales, I created a pair plot that visualized how the TV, Radio, and Newspaper expenditures correlated with the sales. I also generated bar plots for each advertising channel to visualize the expenditure distribution across the dataset. A correlation heatmap was also created to explore how strongly the different features (TV, Radio, Newspaper) are correlated with each other and with the sales.

After exploring the data, I prepared the features (TV, Radio, and Newspaper expenditures) and the target variable (Sales). I then split the dataset into training and testing sets. To predict the sales, I used a Random Forest Regressor model with 100 estimators and trained it on the training data. Once the model was trained, I used it to predict the sales on the test set. To evaluate the modelâ€™s performance, I calculated two key metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE), which helped me assess how well the model was performing in terms of prediction accuracy. This process provided a deeper understanding of how advertising spending influences sales and how machine learning can be applied to forecast business outcomes.
